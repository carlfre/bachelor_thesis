# Bachelor Thesis
## Topic: A Hilbert-type inequality
This repository contains supporting code for my bachelor thesis. The thesis is a slight extension of the work in [The best constant in a Hilbert-type inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07940) (Brevig, 2023).

## Code:
Jupyter notebooks containing the code used to generate the results in the thesis are 
* eigenvalue_two_over_alpha.ipynb
* linear_program.ipynb
  
The first notebook contains analysis of the truncated matrix $K_\alpha$, and the second contains the linear program analysis.
